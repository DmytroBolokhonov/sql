**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


Reflecting on my experience as a Project Manager at Alfa Bank, I recognize the significant role that ethics and equity play in developing systems for credit scoring. The scoring system we implemented was designed to evaluate clientsâ€™ creditworthiness based on various factors, including financial history, income, and existing debt. However, the bank's use of high-risk criteria when evaluating clients raised important questions about the fairness of the system. While these factors are essential, I now realize that they must be approached with a nuanced understanding of how they can disproportionately impact certain groups. For example, relying heavily on historical financial data may inadvertently disadvantage individuals from marginalized communities who may have limited access to traditional banking services.

In retrospect, I would advocate for a more inclusive approach to the scoring system. This could involve integrating alternative data sources that reflect a broader picture of an individual's financial behavior, such as utility payments or rental history. Additionally, involving diverse stakeholders in the design process would help identify potential biases and ensure that the system promotes equitable access to credit. Engaging with community representatives and advocacy groups could provide valuable insights into the needs and challenges faced by underrepresented clients, enabling the bank to develop a more just and effective credit scoring model.

Ultimately, integrating ethics and equity into credit scoring is not just a regulatory requirement but also a moral imperative. By recognizing the potential inequities in our systems and striving to address them, we can build trust with our clients and contribute to a more equitable financial landscape. My experience has taught me the importance of continuous reflection and adaptation in project management, particularly in the banking sector, where our decisions can have far-reaching consequences for individuals and communities.
